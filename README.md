A repo for all of my DataCamp courses that i went through with datasets (as many as i could get). Courses are in Python and R. 
Not all datasets were available nor accessible for the courses and were often different subsets or too difficult to retrieve from their platform. Of course datacamp has 
datasets that can be downloaded [https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/datasets] but none of these were used in the courses. 

Oddly enough, some courses pointed to Kaggle for datasets, so if I missed something it could be there (maybe I missed finding it).
