# Data

The datasets used in DataCamp courses that are a mix of available from their course assets folder, data from within the course and copied, data from their data server, and lastly data from Kaggle.
Data in `.RDA` or `.RDS` will be converted to `CSV` for widespread use and utility, same goes for Python pickle files.

Note:

Datasets will have the course name or associated wording to the dataset as to indicate which dataset belongs to what course. `DataShell_Spotify_Popularity.csv` belongs to the course Data Science using the Terminal.
